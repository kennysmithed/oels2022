# oels2022
 
Online Experiments for Language Scientists, 2022-2023 academic year.

Full content for the course (code walkthroughs etc) in a readable format is at https://kennysmithed.github.io/oels2022/, you can find the markdown source and zipped code on the gh-pages branch.

Here on you can inspect individual pieces of code, some of which I had to zip up in the webpage version for convenience of the people downloading them.
